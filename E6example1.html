    <h1>The story in the book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
      Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her
      desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>,<i>New Scientist</i>, and
      all the other scientific journals her work had appeeared in, was a well
      thumbed copy of <cite>On the Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite
      book since college, and the longer she spent in these four wall the more
      she felt she needed to be free.

      She had spent the last the last ten years in this room, sitting under a
      poster with an Oscar Wilde quite proclaiming that
      <q> Work is the refuge of people who have nothing </q> Although many
      considered her poineering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama
      <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding
      achievement, Molly, <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
