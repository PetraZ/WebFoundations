comments:
html hypertext markup language
h1: head with size1 big,
p: paragraph

always startw with <abc> and ends with </abc>
and we call it a tag, opening tag and closing tag

a tag sometimes is not sufficient to describe 
we add some attributes to the tag, basically key value dics

<html>
  <head>
    <title>head title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is the main heading--h1</h1>
